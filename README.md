# nature\_emulator


# Components
* Rasberry Pi
* Real time clock - saves time on power off
* Class-D amplifier
* 2 Speakers
* USB drive - stores config, audiofiles and nature emulator software
* LCD screen - for time display and basic config
* Scrolling buttons - for setting time and basic config
* Error LED - displays basic errors that arn't shown on screen


# How it works
The Rasberry Pi runs a basic Linux OS, with a few scripts for basic operation.  A USB drive stores a configuration file, audio files, and the nature\_emulator software.  Software on the USB drive can configure the nature\_emulator can be edited manually.  Audio files can be added to to the drive, and set in the config.  The nature\_emulator software runs off the drive.  Configuration file, audio files, and the nature\_emulator software can be modified added and upgraded by removing the drive.

# Detailed operation

2. init scripts
	* check for errors, display on LED
